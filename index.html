            <p id="chaistory">

                My love for tea began as an 8-year-old living with her family in Delhi, India. At my tallest, I would be
                all
                of
                4 feet tall and could never reach the stove by myself. However, to steep the tea and make myself a cup
                of
                chai,
                I would employ the help of a stool. Pretty sure children my age were allowed nowhere near caffeine, but
                this
                has been the sole lifelong addiction I have fostered.
                <br><br>
                To me, Chai is synonymous with waking up, getting cozy, being social, and every day connecting with my
                roots
                through this form of sustenance. The leaves I pick for my preferred base are sourced from my birth
                country
                of
                India and usually from the regions of Assam and Darjeeling. In 2016, I was audacious enough to go on a
                solo
                trip
                to Darjeeling and visit the tea gardens in their full glory. It was one of my best memories of being
                alive.

                History of tea can be broken down into two main periods:<br>

1)	Ancient China:<br>

•	Earliest account of tea being consumed as a beverage date to 3rd century AD <br>
•	Portuguese priests and merchants introduced tea to Europe after discovering the tea consumption in China <br>


2)	Colonial era<br>
•	British East India Company introduced tea production in India to break down China’s monopoly in tea production

                India quickly absorbed the beverage and put their own spin on it. Tea leaves steeped with spices such as
                cinnamon, cardamom, clove, ginger and black pepper and complemented with milk and sugar quickly became a
                staple beverage.

                Wit the rise of globalization, chai is now available in every corner of the world – in your local café,
                speciality tea shops and even the grocery store.</p>

                My favorite way to drink chai: <br>

                •	Steep black tea (best sourced from Assam or Darjeeling)<br>
                •	Add powdered green cardamom<br>
                •	Add non-dairy chai flavored creamer (Elmhurst oat creamer in Chai Spice)<br>
